### Coding standards

Visual Studio Code is the designated code editor. <br>
Prettier is the designated code linter.

## Git Workflow

The Git workflow that the team follows:

- Fetch and pull from main branch
- Create feature branch for developing a new feature
- Commit and push to feature branch while developing
- Once feature is complete, create pull request into main branch
- Have others review pull request and approve it
- Merge pull request into main branch
- Rinse and repeat!

## Local Development Environment Setup

**MacOS Instructions**

- Download Visual Studio Code and the Prettier extension.
- Configure Prettier as your formatter:
  `Ctrl-Shift-P` -> `Format Document` -> `Configure Default Formatter` -> `Prettier` -> `Code formatter`
- Then enable format on save:
  Click the gear icon on bottom left, then `Settings`, search for `Format on Save` and check the box.
- Restart VSCode just to be safe!
- Ensure that `npm` and `node` version 14 is installed and used.
- If you are having EACCES permissions errors when installing `npm` globally, uninstall `npm` by running
  `sudo npm uninstall npm -g`, then complete the following steps:
- Run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash` to install `nvm`.
- Run `nvm install 14`, then `nvm use 14`. This will install and use the version of `node` that we'll be developing on.
- Run `nvm install-latest-npm` to install `npm`, which is the node package manager.
- Clone this repository, create a branch to work on and you're ready to go! Please follow the Git workflow listed above :)
