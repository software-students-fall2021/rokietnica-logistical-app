# NYC ROUTE

**Description:** NYC ROUTE is a mobile app for users to check real-time MTA subway information.

**MVP:** When users open up the app, users can see a map where the stations are shown with different lines at each station. From there, the user can indicate when each line will arrive at the subway and the different stops available to them.
